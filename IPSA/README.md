This is the folder for Independant Positioning System - Asynchronous (IPS-A), coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord.

IPSA is a plug-and-play Quad 7-chip IPS module for the game Starbase meant to calculate and provide information about position and velocity. This README will be updated with current features and statistics as the system is upgraded and added to.

## Features

- A compact module blueprint that can be installed on any ship.
- 0.2 second update time.
- Coordinate and velocity information.
- Add-On support for future projects.

## Requirements and Installation

 You will need 4 Receivers configured in the same manner as 1-chip IPS. You can find receiver setup instructions in the [Current Release](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/tree/main/CurrentRelease) folder.

Included in this folder are two blueprints.

- `IPSA.fbe` is the standard plug-and-play module. You can find the blueprint statistics below.
- `IPSA_No_Frame.fbe` is the same module, but with the plates and beams stripped out for minimalist installations.

## Blueprint Information

Below are screenshots of information regarding the blueprints and how the system is set up.

If you want to read more about how IPSA is setup and how it functions, check out the [How IPSA Works](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/wiki/How-IPSA-Works) wiki page.
