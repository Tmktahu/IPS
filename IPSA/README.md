This is the folder for Independant Positioning System - Asynchronous (IPS-A), coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord.

IPST is a plug-and-play Quad 7-chip IPS module for the game Starbase meant to calculate and provide information about position and velocity. This README will be updated with current features and statistics as the system is upgraded and added to.

## Features

- A compact module blueprint that can be installed on any ship.
- 0.2 second update time.
- Coordinate and velocity information.
- Add-On support for future projects.

## Requirements

- 4 Receivers configured in the same manner as 1-chip IPS.

If you want to install this system by hand, you will need:

- 9 advanced YOLOL Chips
- minimum 2 memory chips
- reccommended +4 memory chips and 2 memory relays
