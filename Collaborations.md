# Collaborations

This is where you will find information about collaborations and other projects that use IPS or IPS related shenanigans.

Note that these are projects pioneered by other developers. I take no credit for their amazing work.

## Waypoint System by Aersaud

This is an easy-to-use waypoint system that allows you to store 38+ named waypoints, select any of them, and then nagivate to them via useful information on a variety of displays. Aersaud has created a version of his system that works with IPS.

For installation instructions, [check out his repository](https://github.com/Aersaud/YOLOL/tree/main/Waypoint%20System/IPS%20Waypoint%20System) and leave him a star if it's something you find useful.
