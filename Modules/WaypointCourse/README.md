# Waypoint Coarse Module

This module was originally created to facilitate races by allowing players to define a race track with a set of coordinate waypoints. As you fly from waypoint to waypoint in order the system tracks your progress, providing you with information as you go.

Current features include:

- Up to 15 waypoints in a course
- Display how far you are from the next waypoint
- Display what waypoint you are currently on
- 0/1 boolean state for each waypoint reached
