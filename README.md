# IPS - Independant Positioning System

[![GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Licence&message=GPL%20v3&color=green)](https://opensource.org/licenses/) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Version&message=1.0.0&color=blue)]()

This is the repository for the Independant Positioning System (IPS), coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord.

IPS is a coordinate based positioning system for the game Starbase. This README will be updated with current features and statistics as the system is upgraded and added to.

For installation instructions, check out the information found in the [Current Release](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/tree/main/CurrentRelease) folder.

If you are curious about how the code was derived and the logic behind it, feel free to check out the [How It Works](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/wiki/How-It-Works) wiki page.

## Features and Requirements

- Requires 4 Receivers
- 0.8 second update time
- Ablity to set a custom origin point

## Grid Alignment

By personal choice, I have made the default coordinate grid alignment match the following picture:

Where positive-X goes inside the belt, positive-Y goes to the left of the belt (if you are looking towards the belt), and positive-Z goes above the belt.

But, this can be changed by modifying how you label the coordinate variables. If you wish to label the axes differently, check out the information found in the [Current Release](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/tree/main/CurrentRelease) folder down in the "Configuration Options" section.

## TODO

- Mono Receiver option
- Fancier display text
- Velocity display?
- Come up with ideas for modules
- See if we can condense the rotation code more
- Research the ability to replace the transmitter stations
