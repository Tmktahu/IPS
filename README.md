# IPS - Independant Positioning System

This is the repository for the Independant Positioning System (IPS), coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord.

IPS is a coordinate based positioning system for the game Starbase. This README will be updated with current features and statistics as the system is upgraded and added to.

For installation instructions, check out the information found in the [Current Release](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/tree/main/CurrentRelease) folder.
