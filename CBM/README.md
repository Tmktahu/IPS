This is the folder for the Consolidated Bearing Module (CBM), coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord. Come check out the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Vafdx5JWBh).

CBM is a plug-and-play module for the game Starbase meant to calculate and provide information about position, rotation, and movement. This README will be updated with current features and statistics as the system is upgraded and added to.

If you are curious about how the code was derived and the logic behind it, feel free to check out the [How CBM Works](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/wiki/How-CBM-Works) wiki page.

## Goals

- A compact module blueprint that can be installed on any ship.
- 0.2 second update time for as much information as possible.
- Lowest lag-time possible.
- Coordinate, rotation, and flight direction information.
- Add-On support for future projects.
